## Table 4. Diagnostic criteria of HBV infection
### Chronic hepatitis B
1. HBsAg positive more than 6 months
2. HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B: serum HBV DNA ≥20,000 IU/mL (≥10⁵ copies/mL)
HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B: serum HBV DNA ≥2,000 IU/mL (≥10⁴ copies/mL)
3. Persistent or intermittent elevation in AST/ALT levels
4. Liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis with moderate or severe necroinflammation (optional)

### Inactive HBsAg carrier state
1. HBsAg positive more than 6 months
2. HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive
3. Serum HBV DNA <2,000 IU/mL (<10⁴ copies/mL)
4. Persistently normal AST/ALT levels
5. Liver biopsy confirms absence of significant necroinflammation (optional)

## Table 5. Initial evaluation of patients with chronic hepatitis B
1. History taking (including alcohol and drug) and physical examination
2. Family history of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
3. Laboratory tests to assess liver disease: Complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, prothrombin time.
4. Serologic test for HBV replication: HBeAg/anti-HBe, HBV DNA
5. Tests to rule out other viral coinfections: anti-HCV, anti-HDV (in person with history of drug abuse), anti-HIV (high risk group).
6. Serologic test for immunization of hepatitis A (IgG anti-HAV) (less than 50 years old)
7. Tests to evaluate degree of hepatic necroinflammation and stage of hepatic fibrosis: liver biopsy (optional)
8. Screening tests for HCC: ultrasound and serum AFP
