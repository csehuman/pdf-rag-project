|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prevention        | 1. Avoid unnecessary treatment: avoid treatment especially in patients with normal ALT and no significant histologic findings.                                                                                                                                            |
|                   | 2. Start with an antiviral agent showing potent antiviral activity and the lowest antiviral resistance rate.                                                                                                                                                            |
|                   | 3. Early modification of antiviral therapy according to initial on-treatment response is needed.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Monitoring        | 1. Use the most sensitive assay for the monitoring of antiviral responses.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                   | 2. Check patient’s compliance to the medication in the presence of virologic breakthrough.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                   | 3. Rescue therapy should be determined according to the result of antiviral resistance test.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Treatment         | 1. Start rescue antiviral therapy for antiviral resistance as soon as possible, especially when viral breakthrough is noted and genotypic resistance is confirmed.                                                                                                        |
|                   | 2. To prevent multidrug resistance, avoid sequential monotherapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                   | 3. Combination of nucleoside analogue and nucleotide analogue without cross resistance is strongly recommended                                                                                                                                                          |
