**Title** Domiciliary oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

**N** 2 RCT studies

**Aim** To determine the effect of domiciliary oxygen therapy on survival and quality of life in patients with COPD.

**Type of studies** Any randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with hypoxaemia and COPD that compared long-term domiciliary or home oxygen therapy (LTOT) with a control group

**Type of participants** Adults with COPD, also known as Chronic Airflow Limitation (CAL), Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COAD) or Chronic Airflow Obstruction (CAO), who received home oxygen therapy in the community. The majority of the patients had chronic hypoxaemia, arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) <55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa), but some of the patients had a PaO₂>55 mmHg at rest with evidence of nocturnal hypoxaemia or desaturation with exercise.

**Type of intervention** The intervention in the active treatment group covered all forms of LTOT including provision of oxygen using cylinders, concentrators or liquid oxygen therapy. In the control group, the intervention was either placebo air by the same method of delivery or no specific intervention.

**Type of outcome measures**
1.  Survival
2.  Health related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument.
3.  Improvement in physiological parameters.

**Results** Long-term home oxygen therapy improved survival in a selected group of COPD patients with severe hypoxemia. Home oxygen therapy did not appear to improve survival in patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia or in those with only arterial desaturation at night.
