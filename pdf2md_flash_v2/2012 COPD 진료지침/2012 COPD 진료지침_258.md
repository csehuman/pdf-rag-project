### Study Summary (Fabbri LM)

#### Author, year
Fabbri LM

#### Title
Roflumilast in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with long acting bronchodilators: two randomized clinical trials

#### Methods
Parallel group study.
Randomisation: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
Trial duration: 24 weeks.
Intention-to-treat analysis: Stated.

#### Participants
1.  Setting: 135 centres in ten countries.
2.  Participants: 1,221 (Roflumilast 500 μg: 467, Placebo: 468)
3.  Baseline characteristics: Mean age: 65 years, 71% male. Post bronchodilator FEV₁ 54,7 and 55,3% predicted (roflumilast and placebo). Average of 43 pack years, 39% current smokers
4.  Inclusion criteria: former or current smokers with (≥1 year smoking cessation) and at least a 10 pack-year history. Aged ≥40 years. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC≤0.7. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ 40~70% predicted. Partial reversibility to albuterol with increase from baseline FEV₁ of ≤12% or 200 mL.
5.  Exclusion criteria: available in the online web appendix (pg10)
6.  Total number of participant withdrawals: 107 (23%) and 82 (18%) from treatment and control groups respectively
Run in: 4 weeks with placebo once a day.

#### Interventions
1.  Roflumilast 500 μg and salmeterol once daily.
2.  Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: None.
- Short acting β2 agonist: Patients used short acting β2 as rescue medication.
- Corticosteroid: None.
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None.

#### Outcomes
Primary Outcomes: Change in mean pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ from baseline to each post-randomisation visit.
Secondary Outcomes: Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ and FVC, TDI score, SOBQ, rate of COPD exacerbations, and use of rescue medication
