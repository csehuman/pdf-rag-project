#### Bias
| Bias | Authors' judgement | Support for judgement |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation concealment (selection bias) | Low risk | "Each study participant who qualified was assigned a number in sequential order. Code labelling prevented the investigator and the patient from knowing which drug was administered." |
| Randomised? | Low risk | "randomised (1:1)." |
| Method of Randomisation described? | Low risk | "The randomization list was generated using a multiplicative congruent pseudorandomnumber generator (programRANDOM, based on Fishman and Moore)." |
| Blinding? | Low risk | Double blinded. |
| Method of Blinding described? | Low risk | "There was a stratification of patients according to smoking status(current smokers/ex-smokers) and treatment with inhaled corticosteroids(yes/no)." |
| Description of Withdrawals and Drop outs? | Low risk | "Over 70% of patients completed the study. The reasons for withdrawal were similar between groups except for adverse events, which occurred more frequently with roflumilast. Withdrawal due to COPD exacerbations was reported in 3,5 and 3,2% of patients in roflumilast and placebo groups, respectively." |
