Title: Effect of 1-year treatment with roflumilast in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Methods
Parallel group study.
Randomisation: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
Trial duration: 52 weeks.
Intention-to-treat analysis: Stated.

### Participants
1) Setting: 159 centres in 14 countries.
2) Participants: 1513 (Roflumilast 500 μg: 760, Placebo: 753)
3) Baseline characteristics: Severe COPD according to GOLD criteria stages III and IV. Mean age: 65 years. 75% male
4) Inclusion criteria: Aged ≥40 years. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ <50% predicted. Reversibility <15%. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV₁ 41%. FEV₁/FVC <0.7 with smoking history >10 pack years, 37% current smokers, 63% ex-smokers; average 44 pack years
5) Exclusion criteria: history of asthma, lung cancer or bronchiectasis, need for long-term oxygen therapy, known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or clinically significant cardiopulmonary co-morbidity
6) Total number of participant withdrawals: 217 (29%) and 163 (22%) from treatment and control groups respectively

### Interventions
Run in: 4 weeks with placebo.
1) Roflumilast 500 μg once daily.
2) Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: 891 patients on short acting anticholinergics.
- Short acting β2 agonist: Salbutamol as rescue medication.
- Corticosteroid: 943 patients continued corticosteroid use.
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None,
Used alongside corticosteroids, anticholinergics and rescue short acting β2 agonists 54% overall (available to all).

### Outcomes
Primary Outcomes: Change from baseline to endpoint in post-bronchodilator FEV₁ and the number of moderate or severe exacerbations per patient per year
Secondary Outcomes: Change from baseline in SGRQ total score, change from baseline in prebronchial FEV₁, post bronchodilator FEV in 6 seconds and FVC, FEF rate between 25% to 75% of vital capacity and number of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment per patient per year
