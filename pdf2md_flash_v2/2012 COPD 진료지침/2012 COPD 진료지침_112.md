Health Related Quality of Life
- Over the 1 yr treatment period, the SGRQ total score decreased (improved) in both groups, but gradually returned towards baseline in the Ipratropium group. Improvements were maintained over the yr in the Tiotropium group, and were superior to Ipratropium (difference of 3,30±1,13, p<0,05).
- Proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement of 4 units in SGRQ total score at 1 year was significantly greater in tiotropium group (52%) than the ipratropium groups (35%, p=0,001)
Exacerbations
- Tiotropium reduced the number of exacerbations (by 24%, p<0,01), and increased time to first hospitalisation for a COPD exacerbation (p<0,05) compared with Ipratropium.
- Proportion of patients hospitalised for COPD exacerbation was 7,3 % (tiotropium) and 11,7% (ipratropium), p=0,11
- Number of hospitalisation/patient/year was 38% lower in tiotropium group (0,10 versus 0,16, p=0,08)
Adverse Events
- Apart from an increased incidence of dry mouth in the Tiotropium group, adverse events were similar between treatments.

**Author, year publication**: Appleton S, Cochrane Database of Systemic Review 2008
**Title**: Ipratropium bromide versus long-acting beta-2 agonists for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
**Search method**: We identified trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'COPD' were searched using the following terms: ((ipratropium or oxitropium or atropine or oxivent or respontin ) AND (((beta* AND agonist*) AND long*) OR ((beta* AND adrenergic*) AND long*) OR (bronchodilator* AND long*) or salmeterol or formoterol) Searches are current to July 2008.
**N**: 2,328 participants, 6 studies
**Research design**: All randomized controlled trials comparing treatment for at least 4 weeks with an ipratropium bromide alone or in combination with LABA versus LABA alone delivered via MDI or nebulizer, in adult subjects with stable COPD
**Aim**: To compare the relative efficacy and safety of regular long term use of ipratropium bromide and LABA in patients with stable COPD
**Type of studies**: RCT and entry criteria to parallel group studies
**Type of participants**: Non-asthmatic adults with stable COPD, FEV₁<80% predicted and FEV₁/FVC<0,7
**Exclusion**: Severe, concurrent other diseases, including cardiac, liver and renal diseases
**Type of intervention**: Ipratropium bromide versus LABA, Ipratropium bromide+LABA versus LABA
**Type of outcome measures**: Lung function-including FEV₁, FVC, PEF, Health status, Dyspnea scores, Exercise capacity
