3. Baseline characteristics: Mean age: 64 years, 71% male. Post bronchodilator FEV₁ 56,0 and 56,2% predicted (roflumilast and placebo). Average of 44 pack years. 40% current smokers
4. Inclusion criteria: former or current smokers with (≥1 year smoking cessation) and at least a 10 pack-year history. Aged ≥40 years. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC≤0,7. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ 40% to 70% predicted. Partial reversibility to albuterol with increase from baseline FEV₁ of ≤12% or 200 mL.
5. Exclusion criteria: available in the online web appendix (pg10)
6. Total number of participant withdrawals: 62 (17%) and 39 (11%) from treatment and control groups respectively

### Interventions
Run in: 4 weeks with placebo once a day.
1. Roflumilast 500 μg and tiotropium once daily.
2. Placebo once daily.

Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: None.
- Short acting β2 agonist: Patients used short acting β2 as rescue medication.
- Corticosteroid: None.
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None

### Outcomes
Primary Outcomes: Change in mean pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ from baseline to each post-randomisation visit.
Secondary Outcomes: Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ and FVC, TDI score, SOBQ, rate of COPD exacerbations, and use of rescue medication
