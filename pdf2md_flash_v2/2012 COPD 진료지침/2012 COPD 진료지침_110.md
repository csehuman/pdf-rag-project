**Author, year publication**: Cook D, 2001
**Title**: Regular Versus As-Needed Short-Acting Inhaled b-Agonist Therapy for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
**N**: 53 patients.
**Aim**: To test the hypothesis that patients with COPD as distinct from asthma may derive no benefit from regular versus as needed inhaled short-acting b-agonist therapy
**Type of studies**: Randomized, concealed, double-blind, placebocontrolled crossover trial in two periods, each of 3-mo duration
**Type of participants**: With aged >50 yr who had a clinical diagnosis of COPD and a smoking history of 20 pack-years, FEV₁ <70% predicted, and FEV₁/VC ratio of <0.7 after inhalation of 200 mg albuterol
**Type of intervention**: All patients received regular ipratropium bromide at 20 mg per puff in 2 puffs four times daily, beclomethasone at 250 mg per puff or equivalent corticosteroid in 2 puffs twice daily, and open-label inhaled albuterol as needed. Interventional therapy consisted of regular inhaled albuterol (100 mg per puff, in 2 puffs four times daily) versus placebo.
**Type of outcome measures**: Primary outcomes included spirometric measures (21), results of the 6-min walk test, and quality-of-life measures.
**Results**: Patients used twice as much active albuterol in the regular use period (mean: 8.07 puffs of coded and 4.68 puffs of open-label medication; total: 12.75 puffs daily) than during the as-needed period (mean: 6.34 puffs of open-label albuterol daily). Despite greater b-agonist use, patients showed similar results during treatment and control periods for all outcomes.
Differences between active and placebo periods were:
FEV₁: 20.04 L (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.09 to 0.01 L);
Slow vital capacity: 0.04 L (95% CI: 20.12 to 0.20 L);
6-min walk test distance: 23.1 m (95% CI: 216.8 to 10.5 m); and
Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire scores for
dyspnea: 0.02 (95% CI: 20.13 to 0.16);
fatigue: 20.02 (95% CI:20.25 to 0.20);
