**Author, year publication**
Cope S, 2011

**Title**
Comparative efficacy of indacaterol 150 µg and 300 µg versus fixed-dose combinations of formoterol +budesonide or salmeterol +fluticasone for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease –a network meta-analysis

**Search method**
A systematic literature search was performed using a predefined search strategy in MEDLINE® and EMBASE®; studydocuments for indacaterol studies were provided by Novartis. Search terms included a combination of free-text and thesaurus terms relevant to COPD, indacaterol, salmeterol, formoterol, and RCTs.

**N**
10,211 participants, 15 RCT

**Research Design**
The search strategy was initially performed for the period 1989~2009 and a supplementary search was undertaken for the period 2009~2010 in order to capture the most recent literature.

**Aim**
To compare efficacy of indacaterol to that of fixed-dose combination (FDC) formoterol and budesonide (FOR/BUD) and FDC salmeterol and fluticasone (SAL/FP) for the treatment of chronic obstructive
