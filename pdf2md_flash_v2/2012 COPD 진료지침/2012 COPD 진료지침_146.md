Title
Roflumilast in Asian patients with COPD: A randomized placebo-controlled trial. Respirology 16(8):1249-1257.

Methods
Parallel group study.
Randomisation: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
Trial duration: Single-blind 4-week run in period followed by 12-week treatment periods, plus an additional safety follow-up period when necessary.
Intention-to-treat analysis: Stated ("The intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were the primary analyses. The ITT population comprised patients who received at least one dose of treatment after randomization. The per-protocol (PP) analyses were used to assess the robustness of the results.")

Participants
1) Setting: 32 centres in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan
2) Participants: 411 (Roflumilast 500 μg: 204, Placebo: 207)
3) Baseline characteristics: Median age: 67 years. 93% male. Postbronchodilator FEV₁ is 55% for both groups. Average of 42 pack years. 69% current smokers
4) Inclusion criteria: Aged ≥40 with history of COPD as defined by the GOLDcriteria. FEV₁ 30~80% predicted, FEV₁/FVC≤0,7 with smoking history >10 pack years. Reversibility ≤15% and/or ≤200 mL.
5) Exclusion criteria: Asthma, and/or other relevant lung disease except COPD, long termoxygen treatment, recent exacerbation that required a course of systemic corticosteroids

Interventions
Run in: 4 weeks.
1) Roflumilast 500 μg once daily.
2) Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: "at a constant daily dosage as concomitant medication if already taken on a regular basis at a constant dosage for at least 4 weeks prior to the study."
- Short acting β2 agonist: "Salbutamol as rescue medication according to the patient's individual needs"
