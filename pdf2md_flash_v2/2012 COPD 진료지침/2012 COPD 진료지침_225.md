## Title
Comparative efficacy of indacaterol 150 µg and 300 µg versus fixed-dose combinations of formoterol +budesonide or salmeterol + fluticasone for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -a network meta-analysis

### Search method
A systematic literature search was performed using a predefined search strategy in MEDLINE® and EMBASE®; studydocuments for indacaterol studies were provided by Novartis. Search terms included a combination of free-text and thesaurus terms relevant to COPD, indacaterol, salmeterol, formoterol, and RCTs.

### N
2,270 participants, 6 RCT

### Research Design
The search strategy was initially performed for the period 1989~2009 and a supplementary search was undertaken for the period 2009~2010 in order to capture the most recent literature.

### Aim
To compare efficacy of indacaterol to that of fixed-dose combination (FDC) formoterol and budesonide (FOR/BUD) and FDC salmeterol and fluticasone (SAL/FP) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on the available randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

### Type of studies
RCTs

### Type of participants
COPD patients ≥40 years of age with FEV1/FVC of <0.70 and FEV1 percent predicted <80%.

### Exclusion
Patients with asthma or other respiratory or pulmonary diseases and other clinically significant diseases that may have affected treatment.

### Type of intervention
Indacaterol 150 µg or 300 µg, fixed dose combinations of FOR/BUD and SAL/FP. Comparators included any of the interventions or placebo.

### Type of outcome measures
Outcomes of interest included trough FEV1 (reported predose values) at 12 weeks and 6 months; SGRQ total score at 6 months; and TDI total score at 6 months.
