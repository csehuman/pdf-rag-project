### Title
Influenza vaccine for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

### N
11 RCT studies

### Aim
To evaluate the evidence from RCTs for a treatment effect of influenza vaccination in COPD subjects.

### Type of studies
RCT

### Type of participants
Adults with COPD, Participants defined as having chronic bronchitis were also also included.

### Type of intervention
At least one annual influenza vaccination. Live attenuated whole virus Inactivated, or a split-virus type vaccine, and administered by either intramuscular or intranasal routes

### Type of outcome measures
Exacerbation rates, hospitalization, mortality, lung function and adverse effects

### Results
It appears, from the limited number of studies performed, that inactivated vaccine reduces exacerbation in COPD patients. The size of effect was similar to that seen in large observational studies, and was due to reduction in exacerbations occurring three or more weeks after vaccination, and due to influenza. There is a mild increase in transient local adverse effects with vaccination, but no evidence of an increase in early exacerbation.
