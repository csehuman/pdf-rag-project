Title
Physiological effects of roflumilast at rest and during exercise in COPD. Eur Respir J 39: 1104-1112.

Methods
Parallel group study.
Randomisation: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
Trial duration: 12-week treatment periods
Intention-to-treat analysis: Stated

Participants
1) Setting: 22 centres in Canada, France, Germany and Hungary
2) Participants: 250 (Roflumilast 500 μg: 127, Placebo: 123)
3) Baseline characteristics: Median age: 60 years. Postbronchodilator FEV₁ is 49%. Average of 41 pack years. 52% current smokers
4) Inclusion criteria: Aged ≥40 and ≥12-month history of COPD. FEV₁ 30~80% predicted, FEV₁/FVC<0.7 with smoking history >10 pack years. FRC≥120% predicted. Peak oxygen uptake < 80% predicted during incremental cycle exercise.
5) Exclusion criteria: Asthma or a lung disease other than COPD, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 2 months, supplemental oxygen therapy, a COPD exacerbation or respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks, a concomitant disease that might interfere with the ability to incremental cycle exercise testing due to leg discomfort alone

Interventions
Baseline period: 2~3 weeks.
1) Roflumilast 500 μg once daily.
2) Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: "prior tiotropium bromide could be switched to a regular dose of ipratropium bromide"
- Short acting β2 agonist: "Salbutamol as needed wer permitted throughout the study"
- Systemic corticosteroid: None
- Inhaledc corticosteroid: permitted throughout the study if taken at a constant dosage (≤2,000 mg beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) for ≥3 months prior to the study
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None.
- Long acting anticholinergics: None

Outcomes
The effect of roflumilast on spirometry, plethysmographic measurements of airway resistance and lung volume, physiological and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise.
