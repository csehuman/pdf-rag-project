2. Participants: 516 (Roflumilast 250 μg: 175, Roflumilast 500 μg: 169, Placebo: 172)
3. Baseline characteristics: Median age: 61 to 62 years. 72% male. Mean 38 to 63 pack years. 53% current smokers.
4. Inclusion criteria: Aged 40~75. FEV₁/FVC≤0.7 with smoking history >10 pack years. Reversibility <12% or 200 mL. Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ 35% to 75% predicted.
5. Exclusion criteria: Not stated.
6. Participant withdrawals not stated.

### Interventions
Run in: 2 weeks with placebo.
1. Roflumilast 500 μg once daily.
2. Roflumilast 250 μg once daily.
3. Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: Allowed at a constant daily dose for those treated before with anticholinergics on a constant dosage.
- Short acting β2 agonist: Salbutamol was allowed as rescue medication.
- Corticosteroid: None.
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None.

### Outcomes
