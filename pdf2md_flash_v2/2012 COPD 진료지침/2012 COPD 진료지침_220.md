Title: Tiotropium for Treatment of Stable COPD: A Meta-analysis of Clinically Relevant Outcomes
Search method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) for studies published between January 1, 1990 and January 25, 2010), with the key words "tiotropium" OR "tiotropium bromide" OR "Spiriva" AND "COPD". We also reviewed the reference lists of all the primary studies and reviewed the articles for additional references. We also searched for relevant files from Boehringer Ingelheim (http://trials.boehringer-ingelheim.com/home/trialresults/index.jsp) for unpublished data and to explore the overlap between studies.
N: 15,131 participants, 14 RCT
Research Design: Duration of treatment: Studies that followed patients for 12 weeks after randomization
Aim: To systematically review recent evidence on the effectiveness of tiotropium versus placebo, on outcomes relevant to patients with stable COPD
Type of studies: Parallel-group or crossover RCT
Type of participants: Adult patients 40 yr old with stable COPD consistent with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society or GOLD diagnostic criteria, who had not had an exacerbation in the 4 weeks before the study
Type of intervention: Intervention: Tiotropium with placebo, ipratropium bromide, or long-acting _ agonists (LABA, salmeterol, or formoterol)
Type of outcome measures: Primary clinical outcomes: COPD exacerbations; related hospitalizations health-related quality of life (measured with, for instance, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) dyspnea (measured with, for instance, the Transitional Dyspnea Index) adverse events (eg., dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary-tract obstruction, and constipation)
Result: Tiotropium vs placebo
- improved Health-related quality of life (measured with St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% Cl 1.38~1.88, p<.001).
- improved dyspnea (measured with the Transitional Dyspnea Index) (OR 1.96, 95% Cl 1.58~2.44, p<.001)
- decreased the likelihood of an exacerbation (OR 0.83, 95% Cl 0.72~0.94, p _.004) and related hospitalizations (OR 0.89, 95% Cl 0.80~0.98, p _.02) but not serious adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% Cl 0.97~1.17, p _.19).
The cumulative incidence of dry mouth was 7.4% with tiotropium, compared to and 2.0% with placebo.
