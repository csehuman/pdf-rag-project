## Participants
3) Baseline characteristics: Median age: 64 years, 74% male. Postbronchodilator FEV₁ is 51% for both groups. Average of 42 pack years. 45% current smokers
4) Inclusion criteria: Aged ≥ 40 with history of COPD >12 months, FEV₁/FVC ≤0.7 with smoking history >10 pack years. Reversibility <12% or 200 mL. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV₁ 30% to 80% predicted.
5) Exclusion criteria: Asthma, lung cancer or bronchiectasis, long term oxygen treatment, recent exacerbation that required a course of systemic corticosteroids, emergency room treatment or hospital admission within 4 weeks before the run-in period
6) Total number of participant withdrawals: 124 (22%) and 32 (11%) from treatment and control groups respectively

## Interventions
Run in: 4 weeks with placebo.
1) Roflumilast 500 μg once daily.
2) Roflumilast 250 μg once daily.
3) Placebo once daily.
Concomitant medication
- Short acting anticholinergic: Used at a constant daily dose.
- Short acting β2 agonist: Salbutamol as rescue medication.
- Corticosteroid: None.
- Long acting β2 bronchodilator: None.

## Outcomes
Primary Outcomes: Post-bronchodilator FEV₁ and SGRQ total score.
Secondary Outcomes: Change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV₁, post-bronchodilator FVC, post bronchodilator FEV in 6 seconds and FVC, FEF rate between 25% to 75% of vital capacity and number of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations

## Notes
There is inconsistency in the quoting of statistical errors. Within the text and Table 2, data is quoted as "least squares means and SD", however in Figures 2 and 3, SE bars are shown. It is more likely that the results represent SE and not SD.

### Risk of bias
#### Bias

| | Authors' judgement | Support for judgement |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation concealment (selection bias) | Low risk | "No person involved in data analysis had knowledge of the randomisation sequence" |
| Randomised? | Low risk | "Treatment was assigned by the investigators with sequential study numbers according to a block randomisation list in ratios of 2:2:1 (Roflumilast 250 μg, Roflumilast 500 μg, Placebo)." |
| Method of Randomisation described? | Low risk | "The randomisation sequence was generated by ALTANA Pharma AG in a blinded manner;" |
| Blinding? | Low risk | Double blinded. |
| Method of Blinding described? | Low risk | "Medication boxes were labelled with the study protocol number, randomization number, and visit code; coding prevented the investigator and people at the study centre from knowing which medication was given." |
| Description of Withdrawals and Drop outs? | Low risk | 100 patients discontinued from study in the roflumilast 250 μg, 124 from the roflumilast 500 μg and 32 from the placebo group |

#### Baseline profile:
