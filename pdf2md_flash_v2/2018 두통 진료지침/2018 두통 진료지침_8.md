Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system used in the NICE guideline, and indicated the level of evidence as HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, or VERY LOW. In addition, the strength of recommendations are provided with ‘strongly recommended,’ ‘weakly recommended,’ ‘weakly not recommended,’ and ‘strongly not recommended.’ In the finalization process of the recommendation, the expert panel survey (Delphi method) was conducted to examine the degree of agreement on the draft of the recommendations by the review committee.

Through this study, we have developed the ‘Evidence-based clinical guidelines for headache in Korea: diagnosis and management’ through systematic review and synthesis of existing evidence. We hope that this guideline will improve the appropriateness of diagnosis and treatment of headache disorders, and improve pain control and quality of life of patients with headache. Recommendations should be applied to actual clinical sites to achieve the ultimate goal of this guideline; therefore, follow-up activities, such as monitoring of guideline usage and assessment of applicability of the recommendations, should be performed in the future.
