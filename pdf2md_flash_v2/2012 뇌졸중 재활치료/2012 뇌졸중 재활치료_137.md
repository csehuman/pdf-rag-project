11. 뇌졸중환자는 적절한 의학적 평가 및 동반질환과 기능적 제한을 고려하여 규칙적인 유산소 운동의 시행을 강력히 권고한다.
    1) 규칙적인 유산소운동은 최대산소섭취량(peak VO2)와 보행속도와 보행 지구력, 보행 거리 개선 효과가 있다. A/1++
    2) 규칙적인 유산소운동은 균형능력 개선 효과가 있다. A/1++
    3) 하지의 점진적 저항 및 유산소 운동(고정식 자전거)이 보행능력 개선 및 운동학습 영역과 관련된 인지 기능 개선에 효과가 있다. B/1++
    (AUS) Rehabilitation should include interventions aimed at increasing cardiorespiratory fitness once patients have sufficient strength in the large lower limb muscle groups. A
    (AUS) Patients should be encouraged to undertake regular, ongoing fitness training. GPP
    (Can) Following appropriate medical evaluation, patients should participate regularly in an aerobic exercise program that takes into consideration the patient's co-morbidities and functional limitations, to improve gait speed, endurance, stroke risk factor profile, mood and possibly cognitive abilities. B(Early & Late)
    (Can) Stroke survivors should be provided with a cardiovascular fitness program to maximal functional outcomes after stroke(and as part of overall vascular risk reduction). Patients should be prescribed modified activities to allow age appropriate target heart rates to be achieved for 20 to 30 minutes three times per week. Strongly recommend that patients participate in a regular aerobic exercise program at home or in an appropriate community program that is designed with consideration of the patient's co-morbidities and functional limitations. B
    (Scot) Gait-oriented physical fitness training should be offered to all patients assessed as medically stable and functionally safe to participate, when the goal of treatment is to improve functional ambulation. A/1++

12. 만성기 뇌졸중 환자에게 동반질환과 기능적 제한을 고려하여, 지역사회 기반의 규칙적 유산소 운동 프로그램이 시행되어야 한다. A
    (USA) Strongly recommend that patients participate in regular aerobic exercise program at home or in an appropriate community program that is designed with consideration of the patient's co-morbidities and funtional limitations. B/1+

13. 독립적 보행이 가능한 뇌졸중 환자에게 답차 훈련은 보행속도, 보행 지구력, 보행거리 개선에 강력히 권고된다. A/1++
    (SIGN) Carefully selected non-ambulant patients, late after severe stroke, may benefit from treadmill training. B
    (SIGN) Treadmill training may be considered to improve gait speed in people who are independent in walking at the start of treatment. B
