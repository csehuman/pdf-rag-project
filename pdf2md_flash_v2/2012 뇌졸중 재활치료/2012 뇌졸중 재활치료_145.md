2. 표준화된 침상 선별 검사는 환자의 의식상태, 삼킴 곤란의 증상과 위험 인자에 대한 문진, 이학 적 검사, 물 삼킴 검사(water swallow test) 등의 내용이 포함되어야 한다 B/1+
(SIGN) The water swallow test should be used as a part of the screening for aspiration risk in stroke patients.
A typical swallow screening procedure should include:
- initial observations of the patient's consciousness level
- observations of the degree of postural control. B
If the patient is able to actively cooperate and is able to be supported in an upright position the procedure should also include:
- observations of oral hygiene
- observations of control of oral secretions

3. 선별 검사에서 삼킴 곤란이 의심되는 뇌졸중 환자나 삼킴 곤란 고위험군 환자(예 뇌간병변, 가 성연수마비, 다발성 경색 등)는 비디오 투시 삼킴 검사나 광섬유 내시경 삼킴 검사를 시행해야 한다 B/2++
(USA) Recommend patients who are diagnosed as having dysphagia based on comprehensive clinical evaluation of swallowing have a dynamic instrumental evaluation to specify swallowing anatomy and physiology, mode of nutritional intake, diet, immediate effectiveness of swallowing compensations and rehabilitative techniques, and referral to specialist. The optimal diagnostic procedure (VFSS, FEES) should be determined by the clinician, based on patient needs and clinical setting. GPP
(AUS) Patients who fail the swallowing screening should be referred to a speech pathologist for a comprehensive assessment . This may include instrumental examintation e.g. VMBS & /or EFFS. Special consideration should be given to assessing and managing appropriate hydration. These assessments can also be used for monitoring during rehabilitation. GPP
(SIGN) The modified barium swallow test and fibre optic endoscopic evaluation of swallow are both valid methods for assessing dysphagia. The clinician should consider which is the most appropriate for different patients in different settings C

4. 급성기 삼킴 곤란 환자에서 삼킴 기능 회복과 합병증 예방을 위하여 개별화된 적절한 식이 변 형, 자세 교정, 보상 기법 및 삼킴 기법 등이 포함된 적극적인 치료 프로그램이 제공이 강력히 권고된다. A/1+
(AUS) Compensatory strategies such as positioning, therapeutic manoeuvres or modification of food and fluids to facilitate safe swallowing shoudl be provided for people with dysphagia based on specific impairments identified during comprehensive swallowing assessment. B
