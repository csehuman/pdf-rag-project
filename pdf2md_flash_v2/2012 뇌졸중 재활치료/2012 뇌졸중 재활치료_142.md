27. 뇌졸중 후 상지기능 향상을 위해서 실제 움직임을 사용한 재활훈련에 덧붙여 운동 심상 훈련을 해야 하며, (권고수준 B, 근거수준 2++) 실제 움직임 훈련이 없이 심상 훈련 단독으로는 시행되어서는 안 된다. (권고수준 B, 근거수준 1+)
    - (USA) Insufficient evidence to recommend Mirror therapy B
    - (AUS) One or more of the following interventions can be used in addition to those listed above (constraint-induced movement therapy in selected people, repetitive task-specific training, mechanical assisted training); Mirror therapy Early-Level A; Late-Level A(Early & Late)
    - (USA) Consider FES and mental practice combined with repetitive and intense motor practice of functional tasks B
    - (CAN) Following appropriate cognitive and physical assessment, mental imagery should be used to enhance sensory-motor recovery in the upper limb C
    - (CAN) The use of motor imagery has been shown in a high quality study to improve arm function as compared to traditional therapy alone and may be a valuable adjunct to other upper limb interventions, and as a precursor or adjunct to the use of mCIMT. A/1++
    - (AUS) One or more of the following interventions can be used in addition to those listed above (constraint-induced movement therapy in selected people, repetitive task-specific training, mechanical assisted training) ; mental practice
    - (SIGN) Mental practice may be considered as an adjunct to normal practice to improve upper limb function after stroke.

28. 기능적 전기자극은 뇌졸중 환자의 상지, 특히 전완과 손목의 움직임 회복에 도움이되므로 강력히 권고한다
    - (USA) FES for patients with impaired muscle contraction, specifically patients with ankle/knee/wrist motor impairment I/B, II-2/B
    - (USA) Recommend treatment with FES for patients who have impaired upper extremity muscle contraction, specifically with patients with elbow/wrist motor impairment B
    - (CAN) Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) should be used for the wrist and forearm to reduce motor impairment and improve functional motor recovery. A(Early & Late)

29. 기능적 전기자극을 이용한 양손 운동, 또는 작업 특이적 운동은 뇌졸중 환자의 상지 기능 회복 에 도움이 되므로 강력히 권고한다. A/1+
    - (USA) Consider FES and mental practice combined with repetitive and intense motor practice of functional tasks. B
