22. 아급성기 및 만성기 뇌졸중 편마비 환자들 중, 손목의 능동적 신전, 엄지손가락의 능동적 외전 및 2개 이상의 손가락의 능동적 신전이 10도 이상이고 이동과 보행의 독립적 수행 시의 균형 능력이 충분히 있는 경우, 건축 상지 운동 제한 치료법(CIMT)을 강력히 권고한다 A/1++
    - (USA) Recommend considering the use of CI therapy for a select group of patients—that is, patients with 20 degrees of wrist extension and 10 degrees of finger extension, who have no sensory and cognitive deficits. To date the only demonstrated benefit occurs in individuals who received 6 to 8 hours of daily training for at least 2 weeks I/C
    - (USA2010) Recommend Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) for individuals with at least 10 degrees of extension in two fingers, the thumb and the wrist. A
    - (SIGN) Constraint induced movement therapy may be considered for carefully selected individuals with at least 11 degrees of finger extension, intact balance and cognition B
    - (AUS) Constraint-induced movement therapy in selected people A
    - (AUS) Upper limb should commence early, CIMT is one approach tha may be useful in the first week after stroke C
    - (CANADA) Consider the use of intensive CIMT for a select group of patients who demonstrate at least 20 degrees of wrist extension and 10 degrees of finger extension, with minimal sensory or cognitive deficits. Intensive training should involve restraint of the unaffected arm for at least 90 percent of waking hours, and at least six hours a day of intense upper extremity training of the affected arm for two weeks [Evidence Level: Between A(Early & Late)
    - (CANADA) Consider the use of modified CIMT for a select group of patients who demonstrate at least 20 degrees of wrist extension and 10 degrees of finger extension, with minimal sensory or cognitive deficits. Modified CIMT consists of constraint of the unaffected arm with a padded mitt or arm sling for a minimum of six hours a day with two hours of A(Early & Late)
    - (CANADA) Intensive Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) should not be used for individuals in the first month post stroke until further research is completed A(Early & Late)
