## 2-1-나. 상지 기능을 위한 운동 재활

19. 상지 운동능력 향상과 기능적 회복을 위해 운동 및 기능적 훈련을 시행해야 한다 A/1++
    - (CAN) Exercise and functional training should be directed towards enhancing motor control for restoring sensorimotor and functional abilities. A(Early & Late)
    - (CAN) Therapists should provide a graded repetitive arm supplementary program tor patients to increase activity on ward and at home. This program should include strengthening of the arm and hand (small wrist weight, putty, hand gripper), repetitive goal and task-oriented activities designed to simulate partial or whole skill required in activities of daily living (e.g. folding, buttoning, pouring, and lifting). The GRASP protocol suggests one hour per day, six days per week. B
    - (USA) Recommend that UE functional recovery should consist of the practice of functional tasks, emphasizing progressive difficulty and repetition.
