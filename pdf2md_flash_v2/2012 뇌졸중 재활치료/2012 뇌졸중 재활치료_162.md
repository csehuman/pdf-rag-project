    *   (AUS) Antiplatelet therapy should be used for people with ischaemic stroke to help prevent DVT/PE. A
    *   (SIGN) Aspirin (300 mg/day) should be given to all patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the first two weeks following stroke onset to help prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (provided there are no known contraindications to aspirin therapy). A
18. 심부정맥 혈전증 및 폐색전증의 예방을 위하여는 뇌졸중의 유형과 출혈 위험을 고려하여 저분자량 헤파린(low molecular weight heparin) 또는 헤파린과 같은 약제나 간헐적 공기 압박 (intermittent pneumatic compression) 또는 하대정맥 필터(inferior vena cava filter) 등의 물리적인 방법 중 적절한 방법을 선택하도록 해야 한다. B/2++
    *   (AUS) Low molecular weight heparin or heparin in prophylactic doses can be used with cautin for selected patients with acute ischaemic stroke at high risk of DVT/PE. If low molecular weight heparin is contraindicated or not available, unfractionated heparin should B
    *   (AUS) antithrombotic therapy is NOT recommended for the prevention of DVT/PE in haemorrhagic stroke patients. GPP
    *   (USA) After documentation of cessation of bleeding, low dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin may be considered for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with lack of mobility after 1 to 4 days from onset B
    *   (USA) Recommend the use of subcutaneous low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent DVT/ PE for patients with ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke and leg weakness with impaired mobility.
    *   (USA) Concurrent risk factors that increase the risk of DVT should be assessed in all patients post stroke to determine the choice of therapy. These risk factors include mobility status, congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity, prior DVT or pulmonary embolism, limb trauma, or long bone fracture.
